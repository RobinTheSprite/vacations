### [Calais to Copenhagen](cheese-and-wine/Overview.md)

# Full Trip Schedule
This is a day-by-day timeline of the trip for the biking group. Each item on the list has a starting and ending city, indicating where we will be traveling to each day. This will fill out more and more as trip planning continues.

**Don't panic!** I know this is a long list of cities. It can be shortened by skipping cities or adding a train trip, it all depends on where we want to go.

Interestingly, [this guy](https://www.bikemap.net/en/r/9617138/#5.46/52.423/6.959) seems to have done a route sort of like ours.
