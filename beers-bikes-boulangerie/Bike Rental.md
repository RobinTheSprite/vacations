Bike rentals are plentiful in Belgium and The Netherlands, it's just a question of whether there are any companies willing to pick up and drop off bikes, and how far away from their headquarters they are willing to go to do that.

**Rental Websites:**
- [wiel-rent](https://www.wiel-rent.nl/en/rent/hybrid-bicycles/) : Has rentals out of Bruges. No drop-offs for hybrid bikes in Groningen, but there might be one in [Delfzijl-Appingedam](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Appingedam,+Netherlands/@53.3186434,6.7758542,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b629ce9e01480b:0x6c9c33fa95191ccb!8m2!3d53.3206783!4d6.8544218), but I would need to check if they do pick-ups at all.
- [ListNRide](https://www.listnride.com/about): Service for renting bikes by owner. Potentially a deal to be had here.
- [Dutch Biketours](https://www.dutch-biketours.com/cycling-holiday-bruges-amsterdam): This company does linear tours, one of which goes from Paris to Amsterdam, so certainly they have the range to do what we need, but the question remains of whether they will allow us to customize at all. We don't really want to follow their route necessarily, we just want the bikes.
