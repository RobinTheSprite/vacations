## Bike Rental

Bike rentals are plentiful in Belgium and The Netherlands, it's just a question of whether there are any companies willing to pick up and drop off bikes, and how far away from their headquarters they are willing to go to do that.

Any way we do it, we will likely end up working with at least two bike rental companies, and asking for pickups. The hardest part will be the Calais-Bruges leg, I think, since Calais is a bit outside the main tourist circuit in the Benelux region. One possibility would be to rent in Calais and then switch in Bruges. Another possibility would be to see Calais, then travel to Brussels or Bruges by train, and make our rentals there.

I also wonder, **Could we hire someone to just drive our bikes back for us?**

**Rental Websites:**
- [wiel-rent](https://www.wiel-rent.nl/en/rent/hybrid-bicycles/) : Has rentals out of Bruges. No drop-offs for hybrid bikes in Groningen, but there might be one in [Delfzijl-Appingedam](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Appingedam,+Netherlands/@53.3186434,6.7758542,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47b629ce9e01480b:0x6c9c33fa95191ccb!8m2!3d53.3206783!4d6.8544218), but I would need to check if they do pick-ups at all.
- [ListNRide](https://www.listnride.com/about): Service for renting bikes by owner. Potentially a deal to be had here.
- [Dutch Biketours](https://www.dutch-biketours.com/cycling-holiday-bruges-amsterdam): This company does linear tours, one of which goes from Paris to Amsterdam, so certainly they have the range to do what we need, but the question remains of whether they will allow us to customize at all. We don't really want to follow their route necessarily, we just want the bikes.

## Buying Secondhand Bikes

This is a legitimate possibility. In countries like BE and NL, the market has got to be overflowing with cheap secondhand bikes. We could just buy some bikes, outfit them with racks, and sell them or scrap them at our destination.

Secondhand bike shop in Groningen, could sell here: [M-Bikes](https://www.m-bikes.nl/tweedehands-fietsen/)
