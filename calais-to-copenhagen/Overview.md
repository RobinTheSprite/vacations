### Origin of the trip

In 2020, our plan to take three weeks bike touring through in Greece fell through due to the pandemic. We took a consolation trip down the McCarthy road instead, but we never ended up going to Greece. By the summer of 2022, it had been four years since our last tour, which was in Scotland.
One day that summer, Dad started yearning aloud about how it had been too long since we had done a bike tour together. I suggested that we tour The Netherlands. He suggested starting in Calais and doing Belgium, too.

So I thought, why stop there?

### Tour Route

This tour, as stated, will begin in Calais, pass through Belgium and the Netherlands, make a quick cut through Northern Germany, and end by going through Denmark to Copenhagen. 

To accelerate our journey, train travel will be used to skip any areas we have no interest in. Most likely, we will want to skip over Germany unless anyone very much wants to visit Bremen or Hamburg.

### Why these countries?

#### Cycling Heaven
The Netherlands and Denmark are widely regarded as having world-class cycling infrastructure. Belgium is not far behind. Taken together, they form what very well may be the most bike-friendly region of the world, *bar none.* I feel that experiencing what the world would be like if everyone rode bikes to be a worthwhile goal.

#### New Territory
I can recall briefly passing through Schiphol Airport on our way to somewhere else before, but none of us have done a proper tour of Belgium, The Netherlands, or Denmark. It would be a new experience for all of us.

#### It Alliterates
It cannot be denied that "Calais to Copenhagen" has a ring to it, no? It is the name of a truly epic adventure, one which we will rank high on our list of adventures. I take this as a sign of destiny.

### Time to Complete: ~4 weeks

### Total Distance Traveled: ~970 miles
